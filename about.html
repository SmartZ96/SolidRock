 	<h1>OUR SERVICE USERS</h1><br>
 	<p>We have anything from 20-50 through our doors on any given week. Our service users are very often addicted to drugs or alcohol, some come along because they are lonely and in need of somewhere to go for some company and support.
Our service users build relationships within our projects and have a greater awareness of services available through conversation with our team. Many have gone on to live drug free as a result of coming into contact with us. Others have spoken of a sense of belonging within the café and feel part of something as opposed to being at home feeling lonely.

 	<h1>OUR SERVICE USERS QUOTES</h1><br>
 	<p>“The solid Rock for me was the starting point of change. A place where I received love. In my condition this was massive and gave me a message of hope that I still stand firm in 4 years later” – Jim<br>
    <br>
“I think the work that goes on in the café and behind the scenes goes largely unrecognised and |Christmas is a great example of what it does for people, the turnout is a testament to the people who work and volunteer there giving their own time to people less fortunate than themselves, many people’s lives have turned around for the better due to the guidance of the people there.” –William
