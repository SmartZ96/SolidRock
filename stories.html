    <h1><a id="story1">STORY 1</a></h1>
<p>Barry Woodward 
Had left school at the age of 16 with no qualifications, Barry was drawn into a local drug scene, which had led him to a brutal heroin addiction and lived life as a drugs supplier.


He was heavily reliant on drugs for 14 years, during which time he spent a few number of terms in prison.

His life has turned around after following an amazing sequence of events in which saw himself become a Christian and has ordained as an Assemblies of God minister.

On Friday, Barry has told us his inspiring story at the Solid Rock which has urged people to come along.

We’re really pleased to have Barry come visit us. This is a man who has been in the very depths of despair addicted to drugs for 14 years but who now lives an exciting, action-packed life, free from drugs.

     <h1><a id="story2">STORY 2</a></h1>
<p> From the age of 12 Julie has been experimenting with drugs, she was searching for acceptance in life. She found acceptance in many different drugs and by the age of 16 she became addicted to heroin and crack cocaine. Drugs had turned her into a girl with no morals and no standards; her life was full of wrong choices. Julie eventually realized that her life wasn’t her own, drugs controlled every area of her life and lost everything and everyone close to her. She had given up on life, desperate and in need of help. In desperation she cried out to God and he helped her to turn her life around. Julie went away to teen challenge in 2005 and never looked back, her life has never been the same since. Julie is now married and has 2 children of her own and has a reason to live.</p>

      <h1><a id="story3">STORY 3</a></h1>
<p>Lisa has grown up in a loving caring family in Fraserburgh and had a really happy childhood but by the age of 16, she had tried drugs including heroin. This was to be the start of a 15 year addiction. She has tried everything to get off drugs: rehab, doctors and councillor’s, they told her that she would never be free and would die an addict. In 2009 her cousin told her about Teen Challenge a rehabilitation centre where she could get help. She met Jesus in Hope House and found out how much he loves her. Jesus had forgiven Lisa of her past and gave her hope and a future. She is drug free for over 3 years now and it’s a miracle. Lisa is now married and working in the care industry and its all thanks to Jesus.

       <h1><a id="event1">RUN FOR THE ROCK</a></h1>
<p> The Solid Rock Café has urged anyone interested in taking part in the ‘Run for the Rock’ event who had raised over £700.

Paul Innes has stated "We are extremely excited to be organising our ‘Run for the Rock’ challenge which will give everyone a chance to dust off their trainers and dig out their sweat bands to raise cash for the Solid Rock Café".

“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response from local people who want to get involved but there are still places remaining – so we’d urge anyone interested in taking part to get in touch."</p>

      <h1><a id="event2">CHRISTMAS CONCERT</a></h1>
<p>Every year Solid Rock holds a fundraiser which is an opportunity for people to donate financially to the cause. Previously there has been the popular Solid Rock Gala, and more recently three locals collected sponsors and ran the London marathon. We have tried something different at one time by planning a musical concert.
The theme for that concert was "The Cross Still Stands" and will comprise local artists performing both well known hymns from the past and contemporary worship songs which focus on the Cross.
The line up and song list has been carefully chosen to appeal to all ages. The soloist's and choir will be accompanied by a live band which features musicians from various local churches.
During the concert there will be a chance to hear powerful life stories of people who have been impacted by the ministry of Solid Rock and an opportunity for people to sew into the work of the cafe.
